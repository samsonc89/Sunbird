            “We were so very lucky to work with Rana as early as my son's
            diagnosis at seven months old. Things felt overwhelming at first but
            Rana was able to ease our minds with her deep and collective
            knowledge on speech delays as they pertain to his diagnosis. It was
            a comforting and rewarding experience to work with her, as we always
            felt cared for and knew our son was in great hands. She helped our
            family easily understand how we could help our son thrive outside of
            therapy and that has been priceless. Rana truly has a gift for
            helping kiddos realize what they are capable of, and she has
            dedicated herself to ensuring families can have meaningful
            communication with children who have speech differences or delays!
            We are proud to have known Rana, and we are so proud of the work she
            is doing in the community!” <br />

            "My daughter began working with Rana at 6 months old after being
            diagnosed with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Rana's calm
            and kind demeanor immediately put my daughter at ease. As a parent,
            Rana listened to my concerns and presented clear and achievable
            goals that involved our whole family. We talked not only about our
            "homework" but also about my daughter's treatments and what options
            were available to her. Rana was an advocate, teacher and friend to
            my daughter and myself. My daughter is now thriving in kindergarten
            and I attribute much of her success and growth to our time with
            Rana." <br />~MH

            “We had the pleasure of working with Rana for nearly three years
            receiving early intervention speech services. She made an invaluable
            impact on my son’s speech and language development; she is
            especially skilled in providing services and resources for children
            with language delays. I’ve worked with multiple speech therapy
            providers both personally and professionally, but Rana’s patience,
            knowledge and genuineness make her stand out among the rest. I’d
            highly recommend her to anyone seeking quality and effective speech
            services.” <br />~TH

            “Our son was diagnosed with bilateral moderate sensorineural hearing
            loss as a newborn. We were in the middle of a pandemic and feeling
            overwhelmed about raising a baby in quarantine, let alone all the
            services our new baby would require. Rana was our first speech
            therapy provider and immediately helped to ease our anxieties. She
            provided excellent education, both for our son and for us as
            parents. She went above and beyond her requirements, teaching us
            strategies and techniques to help our son succeed. She was patient,
            calm, and connected with us in a way that went beyond once a week
            therapy. Our son recently completed a comprehensive speech and
            language evaluation in preschool and received outstanding scores.
            Rana gave us the best foundation for learning, and we credit much of
            our son’s success to her teaching and guidance!” <br />~DS

            years with my toddler aged daughter creating activities that engaged
            my child to help her develop her speech pronunciation. Rana worked
            wonderfully to engage us in activities to then practice and further
            cement the areas of speech that needed more practice. She was also
            great at providing extra resources and learning materials to seek
            out different services as we progressed. I would recommend Rana to
            anyone whose child needs help to improve their speech.” <br />~KT
