            “Rana is a creative and caring speech therapist. She worked for two
            years with my toddler aged daughter creating activities that engaged
            my child to help her develop her speech pronunciation. Rana worked
            wonderfully to engage us in activities to then practice and further
            cement the areas of speech that needed more practice. She was also
            great at providing extra resources and learning materials to seek
            out different services as we progressed. I would recommend Rana to
            anyone whose child needs help to improve their speech.” ~KT

            “Our son was diagnosed with bilateral moderate sensorineural hearing
            loss as a newborn. We were in the middle of a pandemic and feeling
            overwhelmed about raising a baby in quarantine, let alone all the
            services our new baby would require. Rana was our first speech
            therapy provider and immediately helped to ease our anxieties. She
            provided excellent education, both for our son and for us as
            parents. She went above and beyond her requirements, teaching us
            strategies and techniques to help our son succeed. She was patient,
            calm, and connected with us in a way that went beyond once a week
            therapy. Our son recently completed a comprehensive speech and
            language evaluation in preschool and received outstanding scores.
            Rana gave us the best foundation for learning, and we credit much of
            our son’s success to her teaching and guidance!” ~DS

            diagnosed with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Rana's calm
            and kind demeanor immediately put my daughter at ease. As a parent,

              but Rana was able to ease our minds with her deep and collective
              knowledge on speech delays as they pertain to his diagnosis. It
              was a comforting and rewarding experience to work with her, as we
              always felt cared for and knew our son was in great hands. She
              helped our family easily understand how we could help our son
              thrive outside of therapy and that has been priceless. Rana truly
              has a gift for helping kiddos realize what they are capable of,
              and she has dedicated herself to ensuring families can have
              meaningful communication with children who have speech differences
