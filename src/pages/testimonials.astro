                  “We were so very lucky to work with Rana as early as my son's
                  diagnosis at seven months old. Things felt overwhelming at
                  first but Rana was able to ease our minds with her deep and
                  collective knowledge on speech delays as they pertain to his
                  diagnosis. It was a comforting and rewarding experience to
                  work with her, as we always felt cared for and knew our son
                  was in great hands. She helped our family easily understand
                  how we could help our son thrive outside of therapy and that
                  has been priceless. Rana truly has a gift for helping kiddos
                  realize what they are capable of, and she has dedicated
                  herself to ensuring families can have meaningful communication
                  with children who have speech differences or delays! We are
                  proud to have known Rana, and we are so proud of the work she
                  is doing in the community!”

                "My daughter began working with Rana at 6 months old after being
                diagnosed with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Rana's
                calm and kind demeanor immediately put my daughter at ease. As a
                parent, Rana listened to my concerns and presented clear and
                achievable goals that involved our whole family. We talked not
                only about our "homework" but also about my daughter's
                treatments and what options were available to her. Rana was an
                advocate, teacher and friend to my daughter and myself. My
                daughter is now thriving in kindergarten and I attribute much of
                her success and growth to our time with Rana." ~MH

                “We had the pleasure of working with Rana for nearly three years
                receiving early intervention speech services. She made an
                invaluable impact on my son’s speech and language development;
                she is especially skilled in providing services and resources
                for children with language delays. I’ve worked with multiple
                speech therapy providers both personally and professionally, but
                Rana’s patience, knowledge and genuineness make her stand out
                among the rest. I’d highly recommend her to anyone seeking
                quality and effective speech services.” ~TH

                “Our son was diagnosed with bilateral moderate sensorineural
                hearing loss as a newborn. We were in the middle of a pandemic
                and feeling overwhelmed about raising a baby in quarantine, let
                alone all the services our new baby would require. Rana was our
                first speech therapy provider and immediately helped to ease our
                anxieties. She provided excellent education, both for our son
                and for us as parents. She went above and beyond her
                requirements, teaching us strategies and techniques to help our
                son succeed. She was patient, calm, and connected with us in a
                way that went beyond once a week therapy. Our son recently
                completed a comprehensive speech and language evaluation in
                preschool and received outstanding scores. Rana gave us the best
                foundation for learning, and we credit much of our son’s success
                to her teaching and guidance!” ~DS

                “Rana is a creative and caring speech therapist. She worked for
                two years with my toddler aged daughter creating activities that
                engaged my child to help her develop her speech pronunciation.
                Rana worked wonderfully to engage us in activities to then
                practice and further cement the areas of speech that needed more
                practice. She was also great at providing extra resources and
                learning materials to seek out different services as we
                progressed. I would recommend Rana to anyone whose child needs
                help to improve their speech.” ~KT
