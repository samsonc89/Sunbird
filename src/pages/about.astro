          Hello! I am a bilingual (English/Arabic) Speech-Language Pathologist
          and the founder of Sunbird Speech Therapy. With over 10 years of
          experience, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of supporting children of all ages,
          from infants to young adults. My professional background encompasses
          early intervention programs, schools and pediatric hospitals. These
          varied settings have provided me with invaluable insights, which I
          integrate into my practice.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 max-md:text-base max-md:text-center">
          In 2021, I became a certified Listening and Spoken Language Specialist
          Auditory-Verbal Therapist (LSLS Cert. AVT), dedicated to helping
          children who are deaf and hard of hearing master spoken language. My
          specialization deepened my understanding of language acquisition and
          highlighted the crucial role of parent coaching for successful
          interventions. I aim to build collaborative and supportive
          partnerships with caregivers, offering practical and effective tools
          to enhance your child`s language development.
        </p>

        <p class="py-4 max-md:text-base max-md:text-center">
          It`s an honor to be a part of your child`s developmental journey, and
          I look forward to contributing to their success alongside you!
        </p>

        <p class="p-4 max-md:text-base max-md:text-end">
          Warm regards, <br />Rana
